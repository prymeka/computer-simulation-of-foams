# Computer Simulations of Three Dimensional Foams
## Theoretical Physics Dissertation

Dissertation required for completion of B.A. degree in Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin. 

The project is titled "Computer Simulations of Three Dimensional Foams". The abstract is reproduced below (for more information see the PDF and included graphics):

"Most computer simulations in the area of foams have been performed in the dry limit, that is, on foams where the liquid fraction is extremely small, usually less than $1\%$. Wet foams (liquid fraction $>20\%$), on the other hand, do not receive as much attention; nonetheless, their significance cannot be overstated. In this project, wet foams in three dimensions are simulated using the Morse-Witten model as well as the more approximate Durian model. The software was developed to equilibrate foam structures in confinement. High-quality, realistic images of deformed bubbles described by the Morse-Witten theory were then realised using the 3D graphics software Blender in order to better understand the nature of the bubble-bubble interaction."

Note, all errors mentioned in the dissertation were fixed and the code base was improved during internship following summer.
